# Bambu Node

> [!CAUTION]  
> ðŸš§ This library is still in the making. PRs and other feature requests are welcome.

A node.js library for connecting to and receiving data from Bambu Lab printers through
their MQTT servers.

- Every command & response field is documented & typed.
- Easily (and safely\*) construct commands & manage responses.
- Full async support! `client#executeCommand` waits until the command completion is
  verified by the printer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- NPM
- TypeScript

> [!CAUTION]  
> TypeScript is highly recommended for this package due to the type safety it provides.
> This is especially important in use cases like this project where the library
> communicates with external hardware which can very well come with property damage. And
> even with TypeScript, I am not liable for any such damages as stated in the
> [license](LICENSE).

### Installation

```bash
npm install bambu-node
```

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { BambuClient, Fan, UpdateFanCommand } from "bambu-node"

// define a printer connection
const client = new BambuClient({
	host: "your_printers_ip",
	accessToken: "your_printers_access_token",
	serialNumber: "your_printers_sn",
})

// more about the available events below
client.on("message", (topic, key, data) => {
	console.log(`New ${key} message!`, data)
})

client.on("printer:statusUpdate", (oldStatus, newStatus) => {
	console.log(`The printer's status has changed from ${oldStatus} to ${newStatus}!`)
})

// connect to the printer
await client.connect()

// update the speed of the auxiliary fan to 100%
await client.executeCommand(new UpdateFanCommand({ fan: Fan.AUXILIARY_FAN, speed: 100 }))

// we don't want to do anything else => we close the connection
// (can be kept open indefinitely if needed)
await client.disconnect()
```

### Class: BambuClient

Responsible for managing the connection and messages to/from the printer.

#### Events

##### `rawMessage`

Triggered whenever a new message is received from the MQTT broker.

#### `message`

Triggered whenever a new <u>known</u> message is received from the MQTT broker. It's
already parsed and sent using its type.

#### `client:connect`

Triggered whenever the client connects to the printer. This will also trigger on a
reconnect.

#### `client:disconnect`

Triggered whenever the client disconnects from the printer. This can be on purpose using
the `client#disconnect` method or when the printer itself goes offline.

#### `client:error`

Triggered whenever the internal MQTT client encounters an error.

Examples include:

- Unresolvable host provided
- Incorrect credentials provided
- Unexpected responses

#### `printer:dataUpdate`

Triggered whenever new data is received from the printer and is merged into the data class
field.

#### `printer:statusUpdate`

Triggered whenever the printer's status changes to a new status.

#### `job:update`

Triggered whenever the current Job's data gets updated.

#### `job:start`

Triggered whenever a new printing job starts.

#### `job:pause`

Triggered whenever the current print job is paused.

#### `job:unpause`

Triggered whenever the current print job is resumed.

#### `job:finish`

Triggered whenever the current print job finishes.

Possible reasons:

- `SUCCESS`: Triggered whenever the current print job finishes without errors.
- `FAILED`: Triggered whenever the current print job finishes without errors.
- `UNEXPECTED`: Triggered whenever the current print job finishes unexpectedly. This is
  only included as a proof of concept and is 99% bound to never happen.

### Class: Job

Responsible for managing the data about the current print job. It collects historical
data, error codes, etc. It is included in every event starting with `job:`.
